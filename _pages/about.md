Hi :-) I am a Lecturer at the [Mechanical Engineering Department](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mecheng) of the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk). I am part of the [Dynamics Research Group](https://drg.ac.uk/) (DRG) and my research is focussed on developing models for structures exploiting machine-learning techniques. The problems which my research adresses are mainly about structural identification and structural health monitoring (SHM). More recently I have also been involved in the emerging field of population-based structural health monitoring (PBSHM). I am also part of the [Welsh Digital Twin Network](https://wdtn.cymru/) (WDTN) steering board seeking ways to implement real-world digital-twin technologies in the region of Wales in the UK aiming at solving problems of the population and improving their everyday life.

My PhD, which I did at the University of Sheffield, was part of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions 2020 Innovative Training Network (ITN): "Dynamic Virtualisation: Decision Support for Virtualisation" (DyVirt)[https://www.dyvirt-etn.com/]. During my time as a PhD student, I completed two secondments, one at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) at the [Structural Mechanics and Monitoring](https://chatzi.ibk.ethz.ch/) group, and one at the [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) (LANL), at the [Engineering Institute](https://www.lanl.gov/projects/national-security-education-center/engineering/). Before starting my job as a Lecturer at the University of Sheffield, I worked for two months at the [LANL](https://www.lanl.gov/) as a visiting researcher funded by the [Engineering Institute](https://www.lanl.gov/projects/national-security-education-center/engineering/).

After completing my PhD. I went on working as a postdoc at the same group. I participated in two projects as a research as a research associate. The first project was the [Digital twins for high-value engineering applications](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/digital-twins-high-value-engineering-applications-dthive) (DTHIVE), during which I participated in conducting experiments at the [Laboratory of Verification and Validation](https://lvv.ac.uk/) (LVV) with a view to creating a digital twin of a [Hawk aircraft](https://lvv.ac.uk/explore-3d). My second position as a research associate was at the [Revolutionising Operational Safety and Economy for High-value Infrastructure using Population-based SHM](https://pbshm.ac.uk/) (ROSEHIPS) program, which introduced the idea of PBSHM and where I participated in creating an integrated framework for performing SHM within a population of bridges, wind turbines and mast towers.

Before pursuing my PhD, I completed my MEng at the [Civil Engineering school](http://www.civil.ntua.gr/) of the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/). During the last year of my studies, I started working at [Beta-CAE S.A.](https://www.beta-cae.com/) in Thessaloniki, where I developed machine-learning models for the classification of car crash-test simulation results.
