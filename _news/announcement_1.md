It was a great weekend in Los Alamos. My supervisor took me on a day trip to [Valles Caldera](https://www.nps.gov/vall/index.htm), which is close to the town of Los Alamos, for a bike ride. It seemed to be very easy for him, but it was quite challenging for me. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the day and had the opportunity to see the uncommon landscape of the volcano caldera.
