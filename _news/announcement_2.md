I travelled to Cambridge to participate to the 18-month meeting for ROSEHIPS. We had great discussions during the meeting and the progress of the project seems to be quite ahead of schedule. We also had the opportunity to have Christmas dinner in a dinning room within the University of Cambridge, which was quite an interesteing experience.
