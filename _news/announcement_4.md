Our recent work with Claudio Sbarufatti, Nikos Dervilis and Keith Worden, "On a meta--learning population-based approach to damage prognosis" is now available in Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing ðŸ˜€

In this work, we introduce a population-based structural--health--monitoring approach to damage prognosis. We consider a training population of structures with recorded data of damage evolution and define a population model to perform damage prognosis for new testing structures. More specifically, we follow two approaches. The first is based on meta--learning and deep kernel transfer to define the model, and the second is based on functional--PCA and normalising flows to define a functional subspace exclusively based on the acquired data.
We test our methodology on an experimental dataset of six aluminium plates with a crack growing in them and the results show that the population model provides accurate predictions for the testing structures which are properly informed by the so--far recorded data.
